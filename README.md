# Prework Study Guide for Bootcamp

## Description

This project was meant to be a way of learning the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript, by creating a place to store new knowledge about each of these topics. I learned how to create a page, format it with CSS, and add underlying logic to increase functionality. At the same time, I practiced version control to quarantine working code from the main branch.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

As a simple page, you can look at each topic in its own box to learn more about it. If you need help deciding what to study, open up the developer console and the page will tell you where to start.
